### Ancient Trivia Game 
Created a Trivia Game using HTML,CSS, and JavaScript.

## Development Process

First I had a planning session on how I would like my web page to look as a self-scoring Trivia Game. I started with the css and worked my way back to the JS. I realized after doing this it was not the best way to create a site. It caused a lot of mistakes and bugs that would not have happened if I had tried to start with the groundwork first. 

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
